# LIRI
This is uses the Bands-in-town, OMDB, and Spotify APIs to pull information based on the commands the users. The user enters the command in the command third slot(After the node and the file). The command is where the user can select "concert-this", "spotify-this-song", "movie-this", and "do-what-it-says". The commands are self-explainitory but concert-this pulls up concerts for the specified artist, spotify-this-song pulls up the top 3 songs for the given song title or artist, movie-this pulls up information for the movie title, do-what-it-say just use it and find out, or just look in the code. The input comes after the command and allows the user to specify which artist, song, or movie the information LIRI provides.
